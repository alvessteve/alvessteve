## TL;DR

I'm a technical leader with 10+ years building products from 0→1 startups to scale. I write code, lead teams, and drive product strategy—because the best engineering leaders do all three.

**What I do**: Bridge product vision with technical execution. Review PRs. Refactor legacy code. Mentor through pair programming. Ship features that move business metrics.

**Impact**: VP of Eng at Auriga (↓30% bugs, ↓60% security vulnerabilities, monthly→weekly releases) | CTO at Givfolio (built full platform from scratch) | Backend Engineer at Rakuten (8M monthly users, 30% faster responses)

## What I'm About

### Hands-On Technical Leadership

I don't believe in "non-coding CTOs." Here's how I stay technical while leading:

- **Code Reviews**: I review architecture-critical PRs and mentor through detailed feedback
- **Pair Programming**: Regular sessions with engineers to solve complex problems together
- **Refactoring**: I fix tech debt myself, not just ticket it
- **Prototyping**: When evaluating new tech, I build it first
- **Production Debugging**: I jump into incidents and fix what's broken

### Product Engineer Mindset

I build **products**, not just features. This means:

```typescript
const myApproach = {
  before_code: [
    "What problem are we solving?",
    "What's the business impact?",
    "What's the simplest solution?"
  ],

  while_coding: [
    "TDD/BDD for quality",
    "Clean Architecture for maintainability",
    "Performance monitoring from day 1"
  ],

  after_shipping: [
    "Monitor real user behavior",
    "Measure business metrics",
    "Iterate based on data"
  ]
};
```

**Results over activity**: I measure success by outcomes (user satisfaction, bug reduction, delivery speed), not lines of code or features shipped.

**Sustainable engineering**: Green software practices, efficient architectures, and code that's built to last—not rewrite in 6 months.
